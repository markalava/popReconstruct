# This Package

`popReconstruct` implements Bayesian population reconstruction, a  Bayesian hierarchical model described in Wheldon, Raftery, Clark and Gerland (2013) for simultaneously estimating age-specific population counts, fertility rates, mortality rates and net international migration flows, at the national level.
